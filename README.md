# Solar-System

Using basic Javascript classes to build a basic physics and orbital mechanics model of the solar system.

UPDATE 1: Only using inner planets at adjusted scale so they can all fit on the screen.

UPDATE 2: Scales are still too large, even with adjusted sizes and masses. Changed scope of projects to allow planets to interact as accurately as gravitationally possible
